# ThreadSafeDisk Implementation - Options 1 & 2

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a thread-safe disk system as specified in Options 1 and 2 of the assignment.

## Option 1: Design of a Thread-Safe Disk System

We have designed a thread-safe disk system that allows multiple threads to concurrently access the disk without race conditions. The design document can be found in `thread_safe_disk_design.txt`.

Key design aspects:
1. Identified potential race conditions in the nonblocking disk implementation
2. Designed a synchronization approach using mutexes to protect critical sections
3. Implemented buffer safety through buffer copying for write operations
4. Designed a thread-safe request queue

## Option 2: Implementation of a Thread-Safe Disk System

We have implemented the design from Option 1 with the following components:

1. **Mutex Class** (`mutex.H`, `mutex.C`):
   - Simple mutex implementation for thread synchronization
   - Methods: lock(), unlock(), try_lock()
   - Thread blocking mechanism when mutex is already locked

2. **ThreadSafeRequest Structure**:
   - Enhanced version of DiskRequest with buffer copying for write operations
   - Ensures thread data safety through isolation

3. **ThreadSafeDisk Class** (`thread_safe_disk.H`, `thread_safe_disk.C`):
   - Inherits from NonBlockingDisk
   - Uses two mutexes: request_queue_mutex and disk_state_mutex
   - Thread-safe implementations of read/write/wait_while_busy methods
   - Proper interrupt handling throughout

4. **Test Program** (`test_threadsafe.C`):
   - Tests concurrent disk access by multiple threads
   - Each thread performs both read and write operations
   - Data validation to ensure correctness
   - Stress testing through multiple iterations

## How to Test

1. We have modified the makefile to include a test target for the thread-safe disk implementation:

```
make test_threadsafe   # Compile with the test program
make run_test          # Run the test
```

2. The test program creates multiple threads that concurrently access the disk:
   - Each thread writes to its own set of blocks
   - Threads read blocks written by other threads
   - Data validation ensures no corruption occurs

3. Expected output:
   - Multiple threads performing disk operations concurrently
   - All data validation checks should pass
   - No deadlocks should occur

## Implementation Details

1. **Synchronization Strategy**:
   - request_queue_mutex protects the request queue from concurrent modifications
   - disk_state_mutex protects the disk state and operations
   - Both mutexes work together to prevent race conditions

2. **Buffer Safety**:
   - For write operations, we make a copy of the buffer data
   - This allows threads to modify their buffers without affecting pending operations

3. **Request Processing**:
   - Requests are processed in FIFO order
   - After completing a request, the thread that made the request is resumed
   - The next request is processed automatically

4. **Interrupt Handling**:
   - Careful management of interrupts during critical sections
   - Ensures interrupts are enabled when yielding CPU

## Conclusion

Our implementation successfully addresses the race conditions and thread safety issues in the disk system. By using mutexes and proper buffer handling, we allow multiple threads to safely access the disk concurrently without corruption or deadlocks.
